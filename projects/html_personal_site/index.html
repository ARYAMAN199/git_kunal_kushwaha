  <h1>Allen Hammock</h1>
  <p><em>Director, Search Strategy</em></p>
  <p>
    I have 20 years of experience in digital advertising technology, from display advertising to paid search and mobile applications. I have a very strong technical background, working as an individual contributor to engineering efforts while also
    serving in a management capacity to organize and inspire product and engineering teams.
  </p>
  <p>
    While I am a technical person, I find my greatest strength is interfacing with non-technical users and bridging the gap between their problems to the ultimate solutions that meet their needs. To that end, I spend much of my time in front of
    business people, from top level executives down the value chain, helping to get insights into their needs and find appropriate and efficient technological solutions.
