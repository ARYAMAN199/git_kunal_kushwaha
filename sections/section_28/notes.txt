Notes

- watched lessons 357, 358, 359, 360, and 361

24-MAY-2020

Notes

- copied from todolist_ejs to start project
- refactored todolist.js singleton to use mongodb backend
- refactored mongodb connection string to allow for remote mongo atlas
- configured and pushed to heroku with array backend for now

  git subtree push --prefix projects/todolist_mongoose heroku-todolist master

Notes

- implement task delete functionality in singleton and ejs templates
- implement custom list capability (different methodology than shown in Angela's course in order to make it easier to switch back and forth between array-based and mongo-based backends)
- implement navigation system for custom lists

Notes

- finally figured out why mongoose connection string wasn't working for MongoDB atlas; needed to use Node.js connection string for 2.2.12 or later
- fully tested publishing todolist app to heroku using array and mongodb atlas backends; works locally for array, mongodb-community, and mongodb atlas backends
